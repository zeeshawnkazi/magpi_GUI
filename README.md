# magpi_GUI

This code opens a GUI for taking difference-images, in which diamond nitrogen vacancy (NV) center fluorescence images captured
with different applied RF states are subtracted in order to detect magnetic-particle-induced changes to the NV optical resonance
and obtain spatial maps of magnetic field.
